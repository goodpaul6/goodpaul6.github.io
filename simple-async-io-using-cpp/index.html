                    Why Not Use
                    <a href="https://think-async.com/Asio/">ASIO</a>?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, ASIO is a fantastic library, and you'll see a
                    lot of similarities between its API and the one we'll build
                    over the course of this blog post. However, as is the case
                    with a lot of projects I build, I always find value in
                    writing simple code that does exactly what I need; no more,
                    no less.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first advantage is debuggability. It is very easy to
                    reason about what is going on underneath the hood since
                    everything is approximately one layer deep and there are
                    only a handful of files. Thanks to ASIO, we already have an
                    approximation for what a useful async IO API looks like,
                    making the implementation much more focused.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second advantage is compile times. Naturally, the
                    footprint of what we're building here is much smaller than
                    that of ASIO. More importantly, we don't use any template
                    metaprogramming since it is simply not needed for the
                    capabilities we're providing here.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The third is that it is fun. I wrote this code for
                    <a href="https://github.com/goodpaul6/boutique">Boutique</a>
                    and one of the goals of that project is to avoid external
                    dependencies to explore all the details involved in building
                    a production-ready in-memory database (<em
                        >Maybe even use it for some of our internal services at
                        <a href="https://postgrid.com">PostGrid</a></em
                    >). This is (<em>arguably</em>) a lot more fun if we're
                    spending the majority of the time reasoning about
                    interesting problems like "How can I handle many connections
                    on a single thread?" as opposed to "How can I glue this
                    networking library with this storage library?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    TODO Broader point about how problems that *many* (not all)
                    libraries solve are overblown or the libraries are just made
                    to be too general and so their complexity spirals.

                <h2>Creating A Socket</h2>
                <p>
                    We'll start by creating a TCP socket abstraction that can
                    work nicely with the rest of our infrastructure. It is a
                    very thin wrapper over BSD sockets, so it can be used for
                    both synchronous and asynchronous IO (demonstrated in the
                    example above).
                </p>

                <p>First, let's take a look at <code>socket.hpp</code></p>

                <pre>
#pragma once

#include &lt;optional&gt;

struct Socket {
    struct ListenParams {
        unsigned short port = 6969;
        int backlog = 4;
    };

    struct ConnectParams {
        const char* host = nullptr;
        unsigned short port = 6969;
    };

    explicit Socket(int fd);
    explicit Socket(const ListenParams&amp; params);
    explicit Socket(const ConnectParams&amp; params);

    Socket(Socket&amp;&amp; other);
    Socket&amp; operator=(Socket&amp;&amp; other);

    Socket(const Socket&amp; other) = delete;
    Socket&amp; operator=(const Socket&amp; other) = delete;

    ~Socket();

    std::optional&lt;Socket&gt; accept();

    int recv(char* buf, int maxlen);
    int send(const char* buf, int maxlen);

    int fd() const;

    void set_non_blocking(bool enabled);
    void set_no_delay(bool enabled);

private:
    int m_fd = -1;
};</pre
                >

                <p>
                    The <code>Socket</code> struct just wraps the unix file
                    descriptor. Note that rather than exposing
                    <code>listen</code> and <code>connect</code> as methods on
                    the struct, we provide two corresponding constructors. The
                    first takes a <code>ListenParams</code> which sets up the
                    socket as a listener. The second takes a
                    <code>ConnectParams</code> and iniitates a connection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Without getting into the weeds too much, I believe this
                    makes the API a little easier to use. You decide whether or
                    not a <code>Socket</code> is a listener or client at the
                    point of creation, and setting up the constructors this way
                    makes that clear.

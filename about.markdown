Hi, my name is Apaar and I'm the co-founder and CTO of
[PostGrid](https://postgrid.com). I graduated from CS at UWaterloo in 2021. Most
of my prior work has been in games, game engines, and compilers. I'm trying to
see how I can incorporate more of that thinking to the web. You can find the
source code to most of my projects in the GitHub link below.

Hi, my name is Apaar and I do tech stuff at [PostGrid](https://postgrid.com). I studied CS at UWaterloo until 2021.
Most of my prior work has been in games, game engines, and compilers. I'm trying to see how I can incorporate
more of that thinking to the web. You can find the source code to most of my projects in the GitHub link below.
